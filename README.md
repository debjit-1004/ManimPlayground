# ManimRecursionPlayground


Welcome to the **ManimRecursionPlayground** repository! This repository showcases a collection of small projects, each demonstrating different aspects of recursion using Manim, the Mathematical Animation Engine.

## Overview

This repository contains various animations and visualizations that explore the concept of recursion through the power of Manim. Each project within this collection aims to illustrate recursion in a unique way, from fractal trees to recursive patterns and mathematical visualizations.

## Projects Included

- **Fractal Tree Visualization**: Animate the growth of a fractal tree using recursive branching.
- **Recursive Patterns**: Visualize different recursive geometric patterns and shapes.
- **Mathematical Recursion**: Explore recursion through mathematical functions and transformations.
- **Fractal Geometry**: Generate and animate fractal structures using recursive algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these Manim projects, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- ManimCE (Community Edition)
